DESCRIPTION:
            A closure is an inner function that has an access to the outer function's variable-scope.The inner function has access  
            not only to the outer function's variable,but also to the outer function's parameters.
            
            A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
            
SCOPE OF CLOSURE:
            The closure has three scopes.These scopes are as follows:
                   
            1) It has access to it's own scope (Variables defined between it's curly brackets).
            2) It has access to the outer function Variables.
            3) It has access to the global Variables.
  
HOW TO CREATE CLOSURE?
            A closure can be created by adding a function inside another function.A closure is created when an inner function is
            made accessible from outside of the function that created it. This typically occurs when an outer function returns 
            an innerfunction. When this happens, the inner function maintains a reference to the environment in which it was
            created.This means that it remembers all of the variables(and their values) that were in scope at the time.
                         
            Here below is a LINK of examples that help to create closure.

NOTE*:
            The inner function cannot call the outer function's arguments object,however even though it can call the outer function 
            parameters directly.

POINTS TO REMEMBER:
            1) Closures contain a function and a reference to the environment in which the function was created.
            2) A closure is formed when an outer function exposes an inner function.
            3) Closures can be used to easily pass parameters to callback functions.
            4) Closures should be not overused in constructors.
